# soc-analyst-portfolio
Hands-on SOC analyst portfolio featuring incident response, OSINT threat intelligence, and SIEM log analysis using real-world attack simulations, commands, and detection logic.

# SOC Analyst Portfolio

This repository contains hands-on Security Operations Center (SOC) projects
built using real-world attack simulations, detection logic, and investigation workflows.

All projects are performed in simulated lab environments using synthetic logs,
public OSINT sources, and common SOC tools. No real company or production data
is used.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Ransomware Incident Response
Simulated enterprise ransomware incident involving phishing-based initial access,
PowerShell abuse, malware execution, and containment.

Key focus areas:
- Incident detection and triage
- Evidence collection using Windows logs and PowerShell
- SIEM-based correlation and alerting
- MITRE ATT&CK mapping
- Containment, eradication, and recovery actions

### 2. OSINT Threat Intelligence & Adversary Profiling
Threat intelligence analysis of an advanced persistent threat (APT) actor using
open-source intelligence techniques.

Key focus areas:
- Infrastructure and domain analysis
- Malware and hash reputation analysis
- TTP mapping using MITRE ATT&CK
- Intelligence-driven detection opportunities
- Defensive recommendations for SOC teams

### 3. SIEM Log Analysis & Detection Engineering
Log analysis and detection engineering using simulated enterprise Windows telemetry
and SIEM queries.

Key focus areas:
- Brute-force and credential abuse detection
- Malware execution and process chain analysis
- Lateral movement detection
- Alert validation and evidence correlation
- Detection improvement recommendations

## Tools & Technologies

- SIEM: Splunk / ELK (query-based)
- Operating Systems: Windows 10, Windows Server (simulated)
- Scripting & CLI: PowerShell, CMD, Bash
- Threat Intelligence: VirusTotal, Shodan, WHOIS, MalwareBazaar
- Frameworks: MITRE ATT&CK

## Disclaimer

All incidents and data in this repository are simulated for learning and
portfolio demonstration purposes only.
